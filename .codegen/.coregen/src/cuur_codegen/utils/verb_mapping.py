Verb Mapping - Centralized, configurable mapping of API patterns to operation verbs

This module provides a centralized way to map:
- HTTP methods → verbs
- Operation ID patterns → verbs
- Response structures → verbs

Usage:
    from cuur_codegen.utils.verb_mapping import VerbMapper

    verb = VerbMapper.get_verb(operation_id="runCompletion", http_method="post")
    # Returns: "create"
